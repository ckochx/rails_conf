Presentation Notes:

Bad transition from rack to web call as funciotn and again from function to pipe operator.

Benefits of elixir over rails

Each point needs a comparison and benefit of elixir over rails


Pipe operator example. Very confusing.
Break example into more slides.

Pipe in terminal

Show the equivalency of 2 functions without the pipe.

Lead with the ruby example first for piping


Reference ruby terms, ie hash and array, not map and list.

Pattern matching. Enables recursion. (More explanation)


Be clearer about the goal of each slide.


Awkward transition from piping to routing

Explain destructuring -- pattern matching

Controller Slide
Phoenix controller, not Elixir
Missing end
Rename index.html to show.html to match function name


ORM the the typo
